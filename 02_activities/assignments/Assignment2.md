## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
Your answer...
```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customerâ€™s visits to the farmerâ€™s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customerâ€™s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customerâ€™s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customerâ€™s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 


```
Answer: In this really interesting article, we see the author, a data scientist working in the US, talk about AI tools and how in the background, a lot of human work has been done to make these tools possible.
Nowadays we give so much power to machines and their "thought" process, from having them help us write essays, to telling us facts about all sorts of topics, to suggesting recipes and travel itineraries.
Of course, as the article discusses, all these training datasets come from real people, which is:
1. Used without consent
2. Used without filter (for example, from bias)
Not only do we not know about the work performed "behind the scenes", we also do not care, at least to find out more (this is an average).
But as pointed out, a lot of the times, the tools that are used in the "developed" world, or perhaps it is more proper to say _privileged_ world, are created with help from the "developing" parts of the world.
This help comes from people that not only  get exploited, have no benefits, no prospects for a better life, but are deemed "non-hard working" and "possibly criminals" by people that take advantage of them (or take advantage of the system).
In addition, no recognition is given to them in publications or conferences and meetings, despite this being a common phenomenon when concerning "collaborators", "graduate students", "colleagues" etc.
The work that is labeled "easy" and "meaningless" is passed off to people who are "lesser", and yet, the professor at Princeton will get the recognition for their "genius".
We equate work that is repetitive and grueling and "easy" as useless and pointless, and yet, without it, we would not have the tools that we do today.
The power of the machine transcends the power of humans, even though a machine would not work without the energy that humans provide, the data that humans gather, and the coding it takes for everything to run smoothly.
And yet, machine is labeled as "superior" to humans.

Another interesting point is that this information that is fed into the algorithm is not monitored.
Thus, a lot of biases and stereotypes can pass through, to the detriment of the user.
For example, in a scenario where we have a dataset from the 1960s regarding scientific papers and publishing, and you ask what are the contributions of women in science, you may receive an output along the lines of "women have historically not contributed to science to a major degree, because their strengths lie in taking care of the household. Women are not known to possess the scientific spirit required for academic work."
Of course, this is just an example and it is quite extreme, but these datasets have historically existed, before they got populated as time went on.

In other cases, the LLMs prohibit certain responses that are directly linked to the history/ethos of the creators.
For example, a recent LLM called DeepSeek was created by a Chinese group, and importantly, the model does not respond when asked about cases such as the Tiananmen square protests and massacre.
This censoring of information is unethical, especially to the people that lived through these situations.
In a world where AI models and LLMs are the main source of information (who knows in the future?), these biases and censorships will lead to "erasure" of history and the propagation of certain ideologies.
In the same way that hard working people are "invisible" in the eye of the western user, the oppressed people will continue to be oppressed and forgotten.
